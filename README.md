# Stately JavaScript Client

This is the JavaScript (+ TypeScript!) client for the Stately Cloud API. We're
still in an invite-only preview mode - if you're interested, please reach out to
preview@stately.cloud.

This client is currently meant for use from NodeJS server applications.

The client library can be installed from NPM:

```
npm install @stately-cloud/client
# or
pnpm install @stately-cloud/client
# or
yarn add @stately-cloud/client
```
